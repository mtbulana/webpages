	<h2>About Mary Bulanadi</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, I'm <ins>Mary Bulanadi</ins>! I am an engineer first year student with <strong>Computer Science</strong> 
    intent at NC State. During my high school career, I fell in love with programming when 
    I took my first computer science class, <em>Intro to Python</em>. I enjoy working with technology 
    and developing digital programs, which led to my choice to major in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:14px; color:#124559; text-align:center">
    My dream job would be <strong>developing video games</strong>. Growing up, I played video games, ranging
    from mobile puzzle apps to computer open-world exploration. Through this field, 
    I would love to provide the level of <em>entertainment</em> and comfort that I enjoyed throughout
    my childhood. In addition, game development has a <ins>creative element</ins> that I value in a career field.
    </p>
