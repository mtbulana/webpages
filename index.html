	<h2>About Mary Bulanadi</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, I'm Mary Bulanadi! I am an first-year engineer student with Computer Science 
    intent at NC State. During my high school career, I fell in love with programming when 
    I took my first computer science class, Intro to Python. I enjoy working with technology 
    and developing digital programs.

    <p>
    My dream job would be developing video games. Growing up, I played video games, ranging
    from mobile puzzle apps to computer open-world exploration. Through this field, 
    I would love to provide the level of entertainment and comfort that I enjoyed throughout
    my childhood. In addition, game development has a creative element that I value in a career field.
    </p>
